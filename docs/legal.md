# Legal & Regulatory Positioning

This codebase is **strictly demo-only** and does **not** support real-money gambling. The platform is designed for free-to-play entertainment using virtual credits.

## Prohibited by Design

- Deposits and withdrawals
- Payment gateway integrations
- Real-money wagering
- Guaranteed wins or fake RTP manipulation

## Future Real-Money Enablement (Licensed Only)

To enable real-money gameplay, a licensed operator must implement:

- Jurisdictional compliance approvals
- KYC/AML workflows
- Payment processing and withdrawals
- Regulator-mandated audits and reporting
- Responsible gaming obligations (limits, cooling-off periods)

The current codebase includes commented placeholders indicating where licensed integrations would be added.
